## Bio 
I generally don't like to be categorized as one thing, but right now I mainly run a startup.

I grew up in NYC, went to Brooklyn Tech, then went to Columbia and Sciences Po. In college I studied a lot of different things, mostly a combination of economics, computer science, and sociology.  

After I graduated, I moved to Georgia, the country, for 7 months to be a math teacher. 

I returned to NYC in January of 2024. I was a freelance photographer for 2 months, then I started a company with my old professor. 

Since then I have been running the startup out of NYC, planning on moving to SF soon.

<summary><h4><strong>Co-Founder/CEO</strong> - CloudCap - 2024 to Present</h4></summary>
In March of 2024, I had a chance encounter with my old computer science professor and we started a company. I'm in charge of sales, fundraising, product development. Running a company is hard, but also mentally rewarding. I think people should start companies or join early stage companies when they're young, it's a lot more fun than bigger shops.

<summary><h4><strong>Freelance Photographer</strong> - 2022 - Present</h4></summary>
I really like taking photos, mostly of people and mostly at night. Sometimes people pay me. I work exclusively in Black and White, don't do birthdays, and prefer some creative freedom when doing portraits. If you want to book me for a portrait session it's $300 for 2 hours, not including studio, and if you want me to work your party it's $400 for the night. Friend prices are lower, generally free. It's just for fun.

I like music and throwing parties. I've been throwing parties for a long time and at some point wanted to do it full time. I realized it's not for me, but still DJ from time to time.

<summary><h4><strong>Math Teacher</strong> - Georgian American School Tbilisi - 2023 - 2024</h4></summary>
When I graduated college in 2023, I really wanted to move to Georgia. Combination of the club scene, food, and personal connection. I found a job at the Georgian American School via a family friend. I taught 4th through 12th grade. It was kinda chaotic, but probably the best 7 months of my life. I taught Math and Computer Science.

stop1 is my party series in NYC. The concept is simple: a party between dinner and dancing. 

We focus on creating a calmer, more intimate atmosphere where the music and community matter more than the scene. Usually held at 247 Varet in Brooklyn.

**Philosophy:** Good music, good people, no pretense.

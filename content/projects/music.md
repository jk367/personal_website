I make electronic music under the name j.m. kettle. I've been making music since 2016, mostly electronic but sometimes venture into other genres. I also DJ occasionally - I prefer longer sets and playing on vinyl.

My favorite BPM is 133.33 and my favorite record is "Strings of Life" by Derrick May.

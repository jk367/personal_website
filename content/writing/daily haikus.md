**June 14, 2024** 

its already 3 

The day has not started yet 

maybe tomorrow

**June 13, 2025**

again, sun rises 

once more, I walk and I see 

as promised, sun sets

**June 12, 2025** 

a new habit lost 

broken pieces on the floor 

slowly picking up

**June 6, 2025** 

applied, rejected 

bird flying by the window 

plans to go to club

**June 5, 2025** 

i sent a message

now at a new gallery 

maybe I'm not cool

**June 4, 2025** 

need to do laundry 

groceries and vacuuming

cigarette outside  

**June 3, 2025** 

open LinkedIn again 

did not know he got a job 

close my computer

**June 2, 2025** 

networking meeting

who are you, what do you do?

coffee with a friend 

**June 1, 2025** 

everything bagel 

grandma made us a late lunch 

coffee, going home 

**May 31, 2025** 

burnt bagels on stove 

old milk, no paper towels

text sorry, last night  

**May 30, 2025** 

steam from shower head

white paint chips from ceiling fall 

now out of toothpaste

**May 29, 2025** 

old cigarettes butts 

walking around broken glass 

notice a new tree

**May 28, 2025** 

battered foam earplugs

old club sneakers tucked away 

wristband in the trash

**May 27, 2025** 

blisters on left foot  

new coffee stain won't come out  

smile on sunburnt cheek 

**May 26, 2025** 

nest in my window

no egg, no hatchling, no sign

there was no goodbye 

**May 25, 2025**  

sinking feeling 

dead at night, window closed 

morning comes again

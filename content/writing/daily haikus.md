**July 4, 2025**

concrete fills the sky

belgrade, a different world 

wait, where are my keys

**July 3, 2025** 

asleep on the bus 

the mist from the waterfall 

cleans my face of salt 

**July 2, 2025** 

had an awesome day 

there was sun, beach, beers, and fun 

wish you were here too 

**July 1, 2025**

four bed hostel room 

croatian sun, strong today

next round is on me 

**June 30, 2025**

trout by the river 

my head submerged in water 

finally, at peace 

**June 29, 2025** 

grandma made chicken 

a fast car ride to Zagreb 

drinks are nice, not cheap 

**June 28, 2025**

more wine and cured meat 

sun rides off the river bank 

on my back, I float  

**June 27, 2025** 

croatian wedding 

was very hot here as well 

love wins in the end

**June 26, 2025**

cancelled flights and lots of calls

I ate three hot dogs

**June 25, 2025** 

travel day today 

booked the wrong flight to Paris

**June 24, 2025**

the heat was intense  

didn't think and didn't do 

i  just sat around

**June 23, 2025** 

drove to the airport 

I said goodbye to my friend 

one hundred degrees 

**June 22, 2025** 

now, the heat came in

heard it will stay for a while

i am leaving soon. 

**June 21, 2025**

**June 20, 2025**

all the bricks were set  

years ago, one at a time

I will set my bricks

**June 19, 2025**

hot again today 

tomorrow is the question 

i am here right now 

**June 18, 2025** 

today, busy day

doing what? iâ€™m not so sure

busy day, today. 

**June 17, 2025**

sun rises, bright light 

gust of wind blows behind me 

new day brings new night 

**June 16, 2025** 

pressure under eye 

woke up, numb and fuzzy headache 

it is fine, i guess

**June 15, 2025**

citibike jammed 

light rain, fine mist, cold again 

it is fathers day

**June 14, 2025** 

its already 3 

the day has not started yet 

maybe tomorrow

**June 13, 2025**

again, sun rises 

once more, I walk and I see 

as promised, sun sets

**June 12, 2025** 

a new habit lost 

broken pieces on the floor 

slowly picking up

**June 6, 2025** 

applied, rejected 

bird flying by the window 

plans to go to club

**June 5, 2025** 

i sent a message

now at a new gallery 

maybe I'm not cool

**June 4, 2025**

groceries and vacuuming

cigarette outside  

**June 3, 2025**

close my computer

**June 2, 2025** 

networking meeting

who are you, what do you do?

coffee with a friend 

**June 1, 2025** 

everything bagel 

grandma made us a late lunch 

coffee, going home 

**May 31, 2025** 

burnt bagels on stove 

old milk, no paper towels

text sorry, last night  

**May 30, 2025** 

steam from shower head

white paint chips from ceiling fall 

now out of toothpaste

**May 29, 2025** 

old cigarettes butts 

walking around broken glass 

notice a new tree

**May 28, 2025** 

battered foam earplugs

old club sneakers tucked away 

wristband in the trash

**May 27, 2025** 

blisters on left foot  

new coffee stain won't come out  

smile on sunburnt cheek 

**May 26, 2025** 

nest in my window

no egg, no hatchling, no sign

there was no goodbye 

**May 25, 2025**  

sinking feeling 

dead at night, window closed 

morning comes again

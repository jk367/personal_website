**January 27, 2026**

Being squeezed at work

At the airport flight cancelled

I can't get to sleep

**January 26, 2026**

My heart was beating

The sidewalks covered with snow

Leaving tomorrow

**January 25, 2026**

The snow came today

Spent the day cleaning inside

M train to Brooklyn

**January 24, 2026**

Set up the party

Everyone comes to party

Then the party ends

**January 23, 2026**

Icy morning air

Days are long then years are short

Went to bed alone

**January 22, 2026**

Morning air was warm

I had to leave work early

Wine and no dinner

**January 21, 2026**

Party is coming

Made cookies for the building

Seems like life is good

**January 20, 2026**

Mattress up the stairs

Then had dinner my friends

Next door are twenty

**January 19, 2026**

I saw Joe for lunch

I wanted to do a lot

Then didn't do much

**January 18, 2026**

The morning in bed

Chips and tacos with a friend

Finally, i sleep

**January 17, 2026**

Woke up late again

Had an expensive dinner

Not much else to do

**January 16, 2026**

I felt too tired

I did not get much done

To bed very late

**January 15, 2026**

The nights become days

And days begin to pass by

Then days become years

**January 14, 2026**

The same day again

This time with different people

I went to sleep late

**January 13, 2026**

Day in the office

Saw family in Brooklyn

More bars and more drinks

**January 12, 2026**

I worked hard today

How many days we will work

A Grateful Dead show

**January 11, 2026**

Saw some friends outside

Went inside and saw some more

I am so lucky

**January 10, 2026**

Feels like I'm spinning

The cold rain kept us inside

A simple party

**January 9, 2026**

On computer

Hard to tell what is true

A warm day today

**January 8, 2026**

The air is now warm

Just repeating the same thing

A hole in my shoe

**January 7, 2026**

I sit in my chair

The sun raises then falls

Alone in my bed

**January 6, 2026**

My roommates birthday

The days are getting longer

Sun begins to shine

**January 5, 2026**

Back to real life 

Safia is back in town 

Everything is good

**January 4, 2026**

Bagel place was closed

The day with my family 

Sunday night alone 

**January 3, 2026**

The day started late 

I spent most of it inside 

Then i had two beers

**January 2, 2026**

Drinks are expensive 

The year decides to march on

It is cold as hell

**January 1, 2026**

Movie with brother 

The wind outside cold and strong

Day gone already 

**December 31, 2025**

Party then party

It's been how long since then?

It is the new year 

**December 30, 2025**

Waiting in white room

Nothing on the wall to see

The year is over 

**December 29, 2025**

An empty office 

My chair rolling back and forth 

2 drinks at a bar 

**December 28, 2025**

sun sines on the snow

I wake up in a river 

Day passes slowly 

**December 27, 2025**

Old snow fills the streets 

The day and the night were cold 

Woke up in Brooklyn 

**December 26, 2025**

On the plane back home 

Saw old friend at the show 

I made some choices 

**December 25, 2025**

Today is Christmas 

14 years grandfather died 

I am in Florida 

**December 24, 2025**

Early morning flight 

I look at my phone again 

The day is over 

**December 23, 2025**

Snow hits the sidewalk 

Sitting in an empty room 

Dinner with brother 

**December 22, 2025**

Stumbled through today 

I'm trying to fix my teeth 

Movie and then drinks 

**December 21, 2025**

Afternoon wake up 

Had dinner with an old friend 

The year is ending 

**December 20, 2025**

Must have done something today 

What? I do not know 

**December 19, 2025**

Still sick less so 

Italian with my parents 

I had a late night 

**December 18, 2025**

I was sick today 

Tossing and turning at night 

I saw her briefly 

**December 17, 2025**

My mind is hazy 

I can't think i am now sick 

Air outside is cold

**December 16, 2025**

Long day in office 

Going up town then downtown 

Met someone in bar

**December 15, 2025**

My mind and heart tight today 

Good to see old friend 

**December 14, 2025**

Sold a song today 

Played music for all my friends 

Tomorrow airport 

**December 13, 2025**

Joe had a pot luck 

Then Aaron had a party 

Whirling dust settles 

**December 12, 2025**

A flash in the pan 

It was a very long day 

It is over now 

**December 11, 2025**

Night was the answer

Cold morning was the question

I am confused 

**December 10, 2025**

Long drives and long days 

Many hours on the plane

I need sleep 

**December 9, 2025**

Down in Birmingham 

Fluorescent Light flickering 

BBQ and beer

**December 8, 2025**

Traveling for work 

Spent hours in the airport

Convinced to go to the club 

Sensational day

**December 6, 2025**

My legs hurt today 

Tibetan food with friends 

Tired, can't sleep  

**December 5, 2025**

An empty office 

The minutes go by so fast 

I'm in an uber 

**December 4, 2025**

Strand of hair in sink 

It goes round and round and round 

Look up, see my face 

**December 3, 2025**

Brick by brick by brick

I set my wall in the cold

Waiting for the sun 

**December 2, 2025**

Five summers and fall

It all went by so quickly 

Many days ahead 

**December 1, 2025**

Crisp winter breeze

Phone calls I don't want to make 

I will wait outside

**November 30, 2025**

Rain seeps in my shoes 

Conversation with friend 

My time flows one way

**November 29, 2025**

Warm moss on my hands 

A thick mist behind my eyes 

Now the sun sets early 

**November 28, 2025**

Decisions were made

Let's not remember some nights 

Warm sun arises

**November 27, 2025**

It's Thanksgiving day 

A light in my neighbors room 

On and off again

**November 26, 2025**

The past calls on me

Leaves of the tree fall at once 

I didn't sleep much 

**November 25, 2025**

Wet from icy rain 

Today was still like a stone

I will rest my eyes 

**November 24, 2025**

Eyes crusted over 

I had sushi with my dad 

Cleaned up the party 

**November 23, 2025**

The sun hits my eyes

once more, I walk and I see 

as promised, sun sets

**June 12, 2025** 

a new habit lost 

broken pieces on the floor 

slowly picking up

**June 6, 2025**

nest in my window

no egg, no hatchling, no sign

there was no goodbye 

**May 25, 2025**  

sinking feeling 

dead at night, window closed 

morning comes again

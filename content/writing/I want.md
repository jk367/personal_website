I want a bigger apartment, one with a desk. I want straight teeth. I want to get up earlier. I want to text my friends more. I want to not forget my french. I want to get to the gym. I want the sun to set later. I want to never go on hinge again. I want 1,000 matches. I want 1 match. I want 0 matches. I want to be younger. I want to never age. I want perfect skin and hair. I want new things. I want to own nothing. I want my records to unwarp after last summer. I want to play more gigs. I want to never step foot in a club again. I want people to see me. I want to be hidden. I want more money. I want to be thinner. I want to be bigger. I want a big family. I want guestlist. I want people to buy tickets. I want a rent-stabilized apartment. I want a house. I want to get beers. I want to travel. I want my routine to never break. I want to stop looking at my phone. I want to have more power. I want to be better. I want to be kinder. I want to be more selfish. I want to eat more shellfish. I want to be kosher. I want to be liked. I want to love. I want to be loved. I want a bigger apartment, one with a desk.

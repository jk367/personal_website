This is a photo of kids playing on the holocaust memorial in Berlin. I’ve been to the memorial 3 times now(?) and every time there is always a kid playing on it. At first I got really angry, because it’s clearly incredibly disrespectful. The second time, I just didn’t notice it, and this time I internalised it. Sometimes, when really bad things are happen, people just don’t care. One of the most powerful monuments.

## Bio <button class="sectionToggle" data-section="bio">Expand bio</button>

<div class="section" id="bioSection" style="display:none;">
I grew up in NYC, went to Brooklyn Tech, then went to Columbia and Sciences Po. In college I studied a lot of different things, mostly a combination of economics, computer science, and sociology.

Outside of the classroom I played rugby for 3 years, but after my 3rd concussion had to quit. When I was at Sciences Po I was a part of the poetry club, Sciences Poesie, and wrote for the student newspaper. I also threw a lot of events and parties and was a DJ.

After I graduated, I moved to Georgia, the country, for 7 months to be a math teacher.

I returned to NYC in January of 2024. I was a freelance photographer for 2 months, then I started a company with my old professor. We shut down the company in September of 2024.

I then started working at Upfront, a real estate finance company. I was the 2nd hire and did sales and product. I left the company in April of 2025. 

I am based in NYC.

<summary><strong>Manager of Strategic Partnerships - Upfront - 2024 to 2025 </strong></summary>
I worked for my friend start up for around 8 months between 2024 and 2025. My title was "Manager of Strategic Initiatives". I worked on everything non-technical, sales, operations, and design. The founders and I had different visions on where the company was going, so I left.

<summary><strong>Co-Founder/CEO - CloudCap - 2024 to 2024 </strong></summary>
In March of 2024, I had a chance encounter with my old computer science professor and we started a company. I was in charge of sales, fundraising, product development. Running a company is hard, but also mentally rewarding. I think people should start companies or join early stage companies when they're young, it's a lot more fun than bigger shops.

In September we shut down the company. It was a really fun 7 months, and we learned a lot, mostly that I don't want to run a company. I actually think that most people shouldn't run companies, but there are some people who should, and for the rest of us, it's better to work for them.

I really like taking photos, mostly of people and mostly at night. I work exclusively in Black and White, don't do birthdays, and prefer some creative freedom when doing portraits. If you want to book me for a portrait session it's $400 for 2 hours, not including studio, and if you want me to shoot your party it's $400 for the night.

<summary><strong>Math Teacher - Georgian American School Tbilisi - 2023 - 2024</strong></summary>

When I graduated college in 2023, I really wanted to move to Georgia. Combination of the club scene, food, and personal connection. I found a job at the Georgian American School via a family friend. I taught 4th through 12th grade. It was kinda chaotic, but probably the best 7 months of my life. I taught Math and Computer Science.

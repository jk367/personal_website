It is even harder in New York City. Itâ€™s even harder when the party is catering to a niche market. In this paper I examine how one party in Brooklyn, Sksksks, organises its labor force around a system of scene economics to ensure its existence. A complex system of creative networks, friendships, and professional nightlife institutions allow for the party to go on. To start and successfully run a party in New York City, a mixture of madness, charisma, and creativity is required, all of which is present at Sksksks. In this paper, I explore how networks aid in new entrepreneurial endeavours and how this case study can be mapped to more general economic cases.Â ","title":"Kick Drums and Vsco Girls","type":"writing","url":"http://localhost:1313/writing/kick-drums-and-vsco-girls/","wordCount":3730},{"date":"0001-01-01","lastmod":"0001-01-01","summary":"Bio Collapse bio I grew up in NYC, went to Brooklyn Tech, then went to Columbia and Sciences Po.

It is even harder in New York City. Itâ€™s even harder when the party is catering to a niche market. In this paper I examine how one party in Brooklyn, Sksksks, organises its labor force around a system of scene economics to ensure its existence. A complex system of creative networks, friendships, and professional nightlife institutions allow for the party to go on. To start and successfully run a party in New York City, a mixture of madness, charisma, and creativity is required, all of which is present at Sksksks. In this paper, I explore how networks aid in new entrepreneurial endeavours and how this case study can be mapped to more general economic cases.Â ","title":"Kick Drums and Vsco Girls","type":"writing","url":"http://localhost:1313/writing/kick-drums-and-vsco-girls/","wordCount":3730},{"date":"0001-01-01","lastmod":"0001-01-01","summary":"Bio Collapse bio I grew up in NYC, went to Brooklyn Tech, then went to Columbia and Sciences Po.

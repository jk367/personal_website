It is even harder in New York City. It’s even harder when the party is catering to a niche market. In this paper I examine how one party in Brooklyn, Sksksks, organises its labor force around a system of scene economics to ensure its existence. A complex system of creative networks, friendships, and professional nightlife institutions allow for the party to go on. To start and successfully run a party in New York City, a mixture of madness, charisma, and creativity is required, all of which is present at Sksksks. In this paper, I explore how networks aid in new entrepreneurial endeavours and how this case study can be mapped to more general economic cases. ","title":"Kick Drums and Vsco Girls","type":"writing","url":"http://localhost:1313/writing/kick-drums-and-vsco-girls/","wordCount":3730},{"date":"0001-01-01","lastmod":"0001-01-01","summary":"Bio Collapse bio I grew up in NYC, went to Brooklyn Tech, then went to Columbia and Sciences Po.

It is even harder in New York City. It’s even harder when the party is catering to a niche market. In this paper I examine how one party in Brooklyn, Sksksks, organises its labor force around a system of scene economics to ensure its existence. A complex system of creative networks, friendships, and professional nightlife institutions allow for the party to go on. To start and successfully run a party in New York City, a mixture of madness, charisma, and creativity is required, all of which is present at Sksksks. In this paper, I explore how networks aid in new entrepreneurial endeavours and how this case study can be mapped to more general economic cases. ","title":"Kick Drums and Vsco Girls","type":"writing","url":"http://localhost:1313/writing/kick-drums-and-vsco-girls/","wordCount":3730},{"date":"0001-01-01","lastmod":"0001-01-01","summary":"Bio Collapse bio I grew up in NYC, went to Brooklyn Tech, then went to Columbia and Sciences Po.

**May 28, 2025** 

battered foam earplugs

old club sneakers tucked away 

wristband in the trash

**May 27, 2025** 

blisters on left foot  

new coffee stain wont come out  

smile on sunburnt cheek 

**May 26, 2025** 

nest in my window

no egg, no hatchling, no sign

there was no goodbye 

**May 25, 2025**  

sinking feeling 

dead at night, window closed 

morning comes again

&lt;p&gt;Modern life has turned most of us into pure consumers. We&amp;rsquo;re on an IV drip of content, constantly scrolling and waiting for the next thing to show up on our screens. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t always like this, but years of optimization have made our phones possibly the most addictive things in the world. Fortunately, there&amp;rsquo;s a cure for this phenomenon: you just have to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>24 Years - Some Reflections</title><link>https://jmkettle.com/writing/24-years/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 11:23:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jmkettle.com/writing/24-years/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I turned 24 this Sunday and it was a crazy, wonderful, and joyous time in Tbilisi with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of my life there was a mismatch of my perceived age and my biological age. When I was a teenager, I always felt that I was older. Then when covid hit, I felt that I had lost 2 years and that I was younger than I actually was. So I wasn&amp;rsquo;t 23, but 21, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t graduating but just starting junior year. However, time is unsentimental and hardworking, and I was in fact 23 and I did, in fact, graduate. However, after my time in Georgia, I finally feel my actual age. It&amp;rsquo;s as if two gears lined up just perfectly. My early 20s was wrapped up with great friends, loud music, and spectacular food. Now I am ready to continue the march in my life and build something that I and the people that supported me will be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
